# Personal Contributions

The majority of the contributions to this project are not mine. My personal contributions include HTML/CSS skeleton and styling, RESTFUL API's such as Google Javascript and Open Weather API, and welcome page.

# Description
  Ride-sharing website that connects users with identical destinations in the Colorado area. The website allows users to browse information on various hiking landmarks and ski areas.  Information for hiking spots may include the length of the hike, terrain, level of difficulty, and altitude. Information for ski areas may include snow depth, snow type (packed powder, powder, etc.), and ticket costs.  
  Users can put in their chosen destination with a planned date of travel and the website will match with other travelers.  Drivers and passengers can create groups. Users can chat with their group to plan the trip.  To facilitate cost-sharing, the website calculates gas cost and share-per-passenger given vehicle information.


# Architecture: 
- The technologies to be used on the back-end include Express.js, and PostGreSQL.
- The technologies to be used on the front-end include react, materialize-CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap.
- The front-end and back-end will communicate with each other using the handlebars API of Express.js.
- React will be responsible for the behavioral and state storage part of the website, materialize-CSS for styling, PostGreSQL as the database, and Express.js as an API for communication between back-end and front-end.

# How to build/run code
Pull code from repository. 
After navigating to the Project Code folder in you terminal, you will need to run these 4 commands:
```
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo:all
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
```
Then you should be able to get the server running with the command `npm run dev` after which the website should be accesible in your browser at local host on port 3000.

# Orginization
All of our code is stored in the Project Code folder. Our ejs files are in the views subfolder, the models and migrations folders help set up the tables in the database and the routes folder has most of our js. Overall the repo structure is not super complicated.

- Repository is organized by Project Code, Meeting Logs, and Milestone Submissions. Project code contains all relevant source code for project. PostGreSQL database information contained under "config". Middleware authentication for users contained under "middleware". Migrations and models named accordingly. Client side logic(JavaScript, CSS) and image files contained under "resources". Express functions contained in Node.js folder titled "routes". Seed database file contained under "seeders". Test folder contains structure for mocha/chai user implemented test cases. Simply use 'mocha app.js' to run test cases. All HTML files utilizing EJS templating engine are listed under "views" and "partials" contain the header and footer for each page. 

# API'S

- Google JavaScript Maps API, Locations API, and Places API all used under Google Cloud Platform Credentials. Site is able to host ~1000 request per day for free
- Open Weather API used for temperature, cloud cover, and icon data using JSON data from Maps Geometry(Latitude, Longitude)

# Use Cases:
- Registration is intuitive, and user is able to log-in immediately after registering. Dynamic NavBar populates based on if user is logged in authenticated by passport.js.
